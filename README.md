# Global goal
Compare SNe Ic and those associated with GRBs to figure out if there any phenomenological differences in their light curves? We want understand why there are just SNe Ic and also SNe Ic with GRBs.

## Data
Here we are using the public available light curves and other data for SNe Ic from the Open Supernova Catalog (OSC). We applied further constraints on light curves:
* Presence of photometric points before and after peak luminosity
* Presence of spectroscopic redshift
* Range of redshifts < 0.40 for taking the selective effects of SN GRBs into account

These light curves we are comparing with our and public available light curves of SN GRBs.

## Method
To compare both types of light curves in terms of their peak brightness and shape parameters, the Bazin's function fitting is used ([Bazin G. et al., 2009](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009A%26A...499..653B/abstract).

Some of the analyzed parameters are:
* M_V(delta_m15) dependency in comparison with luminosity-width (Phillips) relation for SNe Ia ([Phillips M., 1993] (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993ApJ...413L.105P/abstract)
* Time of rise and time of fall
* Full width at half maximum
